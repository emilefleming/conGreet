### Description

conGreet is a web app that allows the user to quickly and easily find their elected officials in the U.S. Congress. Users are presented with small cards for their officials that contain links to quickly call them and voice their opinion.

### Tech

This project is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. It also uses the Materialize framework and jQuery.


### Features

Users start by entering their address and are presented with their three representatives, two in the Senate and one in the House.

Each legislator is shown as a card containing a link to quickly call their official line as well as a link to load a 'profile page' for that official. Profile pages contain basic contact information as well as their five most recent votes in their respective chamber and their five most recent youtube videos. Clicking on a vote brings the user to a profile page for that vote's corresponding piece of legislation. There the user can see who sponsored and co-sponsored the bill and any votes that have been taken in relation to that bill.

## Future development

1. Watch list to track arbitrary legislators

1. More powerful search Features

1. Additional information on individuals

1. Additional information on bills

1. Newsfeed including tweets, videos, and votes
