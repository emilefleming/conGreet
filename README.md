# conGreet

conGreet is a web app that allows the user to quickly and easily find their elected officials in the U.S. Congress.

Users start by entering their address and are presented with their three representatives, two in the Senate and one in the House.

Each legislator is shown as a card containing a link to quickly call their official line as well as a link to load a 'profile page' for that official. Profile pages contain basic contact information as well as their five most recent votes in their respective chamber and their five most recent youtube videos. Clicking on a vote brings the user to a profile page for that vote's corresponding piece of legislation. There the user can see who sponsored and co-sponsored the bill and any votes that have been taken in relation to that bill.

Watch the video below for a demonstration of the app as it exists on December 12th, 2016 or about 40-50 hours into the project.
